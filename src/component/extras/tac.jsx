You undertake and agree that once a Guest requests to book your Accommodation, the price for the booking cannot be changed.

(6)Host shall choose a cancellation policy among the ones proposed by uilaution. The selected cancellation policy may be changed by the Host at any time and shall be applicable to all Listings.

 (7)Failure to comply with the obligations set forth in these terms and conditions may result in Host’s permanent exclusion from the Site and from any of its affiliated sites.

(8)As a Host, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and for those of any individuals who reside at or are otherwise present at the Accommodation at your request or invitation, including Guests. We advise you to consider and obtain appropriate insurances for your Accommodations, which are your sole responsibility.

(9)Sort order for Listings depends on uilaution’s algorithms and may vary from time to time. No guarantee is given on any position within the search results, but the position of a Listing can be improved through quality criteria, such as number and quality of pictures, rates, description, calendar updates, etc.

(10)Listings may be displayed on other sites of uilaution’s affiliates, and on the sites of companies with which uilaution may have signed distribution agreements, to the extent that such sites enable online payment. However, uilaution gives no guarantee of publication other than on the Site where Advertiser originally registered its Listing and within the limit of uilaution’s right to publish a Listing or not.

(11)Listing will be displayed on the Site indefinitely; however uilaution reserves the right to remove or refuse to publish any Listing at any time in its sole discretion. Advertiser can also suspend or remove their Listings at any time, through their dashboard or by contacting customer service.

5.	Account registration and using the Services

(1)In order to create a Listing, you must first register an account. You can register an Account and become a Member by logging into your account with certain third party social networking sites, including Facebook. We will create your Account and your profile page based upon the information you provide to us or which we obtain from third party social networking sites. Upon registration, a Host is given a user profile in which the data he contributes is recorded and in which all the Accommodation rentals offered by that Host are specified (the “Dashboard”).

(2)You shall not have more than one Account. You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and to update the information to keep it accurate, current and complete. uilaution may suspend or terminate your Account and your use of the Services if you create more than one Account or if any information you provide are inaccurate or false.

(3)The Dashboard provide various functions which are intended to assist Hosts to manage their Accommodations through the site; these functions, and the Dashboard itself, are made available on an “as is” basis, and uilaution does not undertake that the Dashboard or its functions will be complete or error-free.

(4)Guests may also post their own reviews of Hosts’ Accommodations (“Guest Reviews”) on the site. The Host is given the opportunity to view Guest Reviews, and to respond to them (a “Host Response”). Please note that uilaution does not, and does not realistically have the ability to, verify the accuracy or otherwise of Guest Reviews. The Host’s sole remedy, and uilaution’s sole obligation, in the event that an Host disputes any aspect of a Guest Review is to permit the Host to post an Host Response to it.

(5)uilaution requires all Guest Reviews, Host Responses and other communications to conform to these Host Terms and the Guest Terms, and may decline to post any of them that uilaution finds does not do so. In the event that any Guest Review or Host Response appears on the site but fails to conform to the Host Terms or Guest Terms, then without prejudice to any other available remedies, uilaution shall be entitled immediately to remove from the site the relevant non-conforming Guest Reviews and Host Responses.

(6)Enquiries and communications sent using the uilaution system are available for review by the Guest who originally sent it and to a limited number of   Group customer service employees, who may be asked by Guests or others for their past enquiry information.   Group also monitors messages from time to time which are sent using uilaution platform or systems. uilaution may, from time to time, use third party e-mail servers to send and track receipt of emails, and analyse the pattern of emails sent using third party tracking systems. uilaution’s system does not hold messages indefinitely and they may not be accessible after the message has been delivered.
Hosts should print a copy of any message which is important – for example a payment receipt or a booking confirmation.

(7)uilaution has no responsibility for, or involvement in, the communications between the Host and Guest.

6.	Listing Details and Services

(1)The display of the Host’s Listing is dependent on variable algorithms and therefore no guarantee is given to the Host as to the order its Listing will appear in the search results list.

(2)A search summary snippet (either with or without a picture of the Accommodation) and linked to the full-page Listing (with or without machine-translated text) may appear on the websites of affiliates of uilaution (including affiliates in other countries) (collectively, “uilaution Affiliates”). The availability of search snippets, and the inclusion of Accommodation photos in them, on such uilaution Affiliate websites is dependent on the availability of the relevant functionality on those websites. The Host acknowledges that these search summary snippets may appear very low in the search hierarchy of the relevant websites.





(3)Accommodation search snippets are searched and displayed based on uilaution’s sort algorithm. Guests can also filter Listings according to various criteria, such as, but not limited to:
•The average review score
•The number of bedrooms, bathrooms and/or beds
•The number of reviews
•The pricing

7.	Additional Services

uilaution may make available, and may from time to time add to or remove, certain additional programs, options, and/or promotions to all or selected Hosts (the “Additional Services”). The Additional Services may be offered or made available on an options or mandatory basis and in any case will be subject to additional terms and conditions which will be notified to the eligible Hosts. By accepting, selecting or participating in these Additional Services, including by continuing to use the Additional Services, in the case of mandatory programs or options, the Host also agrees to such additional terms and conditions, which will be deemed to be incorporated by reference into these Terms with respect to such Additional Services.

b. a Host has submitted unsuitable material to, or misused, the site;

(3)uilaution may occasionally undertake upgrades of the site in order to address technological developments.

Each Host acknowledges that failure to comply with any such request constitutes a breach of these Host Ts&Cs.

The Privacy Policy provides further details. uilaution may where necessary (including to prevent fraudulent behaviour of a third party) give an Host`s phone number to a Guest. The Host accepts that it has read the site’s Privacy Policy and Cookie Notice and consents to the processing of data as outlined in those policies.

(6)uilaution reserves the right to transfer these Host Ts&Cs, and to assign or subcontract any or all of its rights and obligations under these Host Ts&Cs, to a third party but will not do so in such a way as to reduce any guarantees given to the Host under these Host Ts&Cs.
